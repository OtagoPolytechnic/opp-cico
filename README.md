# opp-cico

**Overview**

The goal of opp-cico is to provide BIT students and lecturers with an in-house item management system to track items that may be handed out during a course. This enables the lecturer to always keep track of an item weather it is in storage at Polytechnic or has been lent out to a student. This tool is useful because lecturers will now have historical and real time records of where an item is and where it has gone. This means if an item goes missing or needs to be returned the lecturer has the ability to track it down.
